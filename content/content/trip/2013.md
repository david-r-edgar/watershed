# 2013: Dunnet Head to Dalwhinnie

I started at Dunnet Head with the aim of walking the entire length of the route to Leathercote Point in one go.

After a preliminary leg along the watershed line from Duncansby Head (the main alternative end point in the neighbourhood), I started the route proper on 6th July 2013 at 11am.
