# 1st August 2020

I had scheduled my trip specifically in order to reach High Cup Nick by this weekend - because the Warcop MOD firing range is situated across the watershed, and this was to be one of their pre-announced no-firing weekends.

After the sun of the previous day, I was surprised and a little disappointed to awake to mist, but it did move around and lift a bit as the morning progressed.

Apart from warning signs on entering and leaving the area, and a few distant glimpses of some kind of structures, perhaps temporary targets, there was actually little to distinguish Warcop from all the other moors I had crossed. I didn't see any items of unexploded ordnance.

By the time I reached the summit of Little Fell with its deteriorated OS triangulation column, the clouds had lifted well above the tops.

I continued on across Stainmore Common and Great Knipe, camping somewhere in the middle of anonymous and featureless Beldoo Moss.
