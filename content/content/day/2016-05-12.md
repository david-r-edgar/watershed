# 12th May 2016

I started part 2 of my watershed walk 2 days ago, with another week to go. The sun has been shining, the ground mostly dry, with just a bit of wind. Good progress so far, across Ben Alder and on to the loop round Rannoch Moor. The only mishap was slipping on some squelchy ground below a melting patch of snow and landing on one of my trekking poles and bending itâ€¦ Now heading towards Glencoe.
