# 30th July 2020

With quite a bit of rain falling in the morning, I delayed my start for some hours, and I wasn't feeling particularly energetic in any case.

After Cold Fell, the watershed ridge initially heads south with relatively few deviations or height losses.

The remains of a 1957 air crash on Farlam Currick were one of the few unusual sights on the ridge.

I frequently saw movements in the grass as I walked past - mice or voles, I think, darting back into their holes before I could look at them properly. And they were not ignored by predators in the skies. Over the course of the next few days, I saw numerous birds of prey - slightly to my surprise, most commonly owls.

I camped near Black Fell, and a short-eared owl briefly came and sat on a fence-post within 10m of my tent, apparently watching me.
