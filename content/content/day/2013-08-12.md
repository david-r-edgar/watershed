# 12th August 2013

It's been a satisfying day's walking today, though it isn't over yet. Despite the intermittent showers and on-and-off strong wind, the Stob Poite Coire Ardair ridge has made for good hiking.

Currently taking a short break on the sheltered side of the ridge, overlooking Kinloch Laggan.

Left the Great Glen two days ago in the evening, camping not far above the forest.

Yesterday it rained for hours and hours, but I still managed most of the distance I intended.

Profuse bilberries on the lower slopes have been very tasty over the last few days. I've also found a few very sporadic cloudberries, which are extremely yummy!
