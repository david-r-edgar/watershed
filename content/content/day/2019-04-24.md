# 24th April 2019


I've been following the Clyde catchment for what seems like ever. (Since Ben Lui, if I recall correctly - several hundred kilometres.) But today another milestone passed - at the appropriately named Clyde Law, I finished with it. Water on my right now flows into the Annan and thence into the Solway Firth. The Tweed drains my left-hand side - I'm writing this about 1km from Tweed's Well, the river's source.


The ground is really dry, which makes for good progress. I had been hoping to end this trip at Mosspaul on the A7, but there's a good chance I'll get further than that - maybe even past Peel Fell.


But first to see what the coming days bring - the first touch of mist this morning, with rain forecast tomorrow and Friday.


The Southern Uplands have so far brought some excellent walking - hopefully more to follow.
