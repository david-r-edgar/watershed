# 3rd August 2020

Today I passed - although neither were obvious on the ground - the source of the Eden, near Hugh Seat, and the source of the Ure, just a few km later at Ure Head.

The watershed turns to the west at Ure Head, and descends to the top of the Eden Valley, to where it crosses the Settle-Carlisle railway at Aisgill Summit, the highest point on the line.

Having lost all the height from the ridge to the east, the watershed then climbs back up a very similar elevation, to Swarth Fell Pike. From a peak-bagging perspective, it's a wasted ascent, since without reaching the true summit of Swarth Fell, it immediately starts descending back down again to the valley - and the railway - a little further south. However, Swarth Fell Pike is notable for a significant change of catchment area - this time on the west side. We've been following the Solway Firth catchment - via the Esk and then the Eden - for a long time, since barely half-way through the Southern Uplands. Now that changes: south of here, the watershed follows the Lune catchment, which in one sense moves us from north of the Lake District to south.

This was my final day, and though I had always intended to finish at Garsdale Head, I was in two minds as to whether to push on that little bit further, and reach Dent station instead. I might have had time, but I dithered, and eventually decided I had had a sufficiently successful trip, and that Garsdale station, being exceptionally close to the line of the watershed, made a sensible point to stop.

At Garsdale Head, the road, railway and watershed cross at more or less exactly the same point, where Wensleydale descends to the east, but all going in somewhat different directions.

Annoyingly missing one train by less than a minute, I had an hour and a half to wait at Garsdale station. I watched a red squirrel emerge through a fence, look around before crossing the platforms and track and then exit through the fence on the other side. Some minutes later it returned, following the same route in reverse. It was clearly habitual behaviour, since perhaps 15 minutes later it repeated the same journey, again in both directions...
