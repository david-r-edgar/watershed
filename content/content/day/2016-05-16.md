# 16th May 2016

I'm in sight of Tyndrum now, just resting on a very steep downhill from Beinn Odhar towards the noisy road, the WHW and the railway line. Today's progress has been slow but steady, with a lot of ascent and descent. The ground's dry, however.

I've been very lucky with the weather so far; mostly it's been fine, if breezy and a bit cold. Tomorrow's looking like the first rainy day, so I'm not expecting to see much from Ben Lui et al.

Managed to bag three bonus Munros yesterday, since I had time to spare.

Due to travel back home on Thursday, so it shouldn't be too difficult to get to Crianlarich by then. 10km as the crow flies, or 30km as the watershed wigglesâ€¦
