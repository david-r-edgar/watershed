# 7th May 2018

I arrived back in Crianlarich on Saturday for part 3, and started with a warm-up day doing Ben More and Stob Binnein. Rather misty on the tops, but most of the snow had gone. Then after getting back to town, I continued just a little along the watershed in the evening, making it up above the trees. Five Munros yesterday (one a bonus one, not quite on the watershed) made for a tiring but short (in distance) day. Largely kind weather, in and out of the cloud on the summits. Currently stopped for a break above the north end of Loch Lomond. A circuitous route should line me up for Ben Lomond tomorrow, all being well.
