# 17th October 2020

At very short notice, on Friday evening, travel out of Manchester was still technically allowed, so I took the opportunity for a weekend on the watershed. It was past midday when I arrived in Garsdale, so I didn't have all that much hiking time.

Widdale Great Tarn sits basically on the watershed. The landranger suggests it drains to the east, but larger scales show it draining to the west. My interpretation - and that of the county boundary - places the tarn to the west of the watershed.

Wold Fell may only really be a subsidiary top of Great Knoutberry Hill, but here the streams on the Irish Sea side stop flowing via the Lune, and start flowing via the Ribble instead. Ribblehead is not far away - but technically the source of the river (albeit not named as such) must be somewhere in this direction.
