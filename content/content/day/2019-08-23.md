# 23rd August 2019

My plans to get the bus back to Whitrope failed, due in part to the bus company putting the wrong number on the bus in Hawick, and in part due to my own mistake in working out when and where alternative buses left from... So I walked several hours up the road - meaning it was already past 3pm by the time I was able to continue on the watershed route itself. Immediately I found long grass and awkward forest plantations would not be making my life easy. The forecast sunshine was invisible above the unexpected mist, too.

I had been hoping to make it out of the forest by the end of the day, but at sunset, having reached "Mag and the Bairns", the name the map gives to the cairns on top of Needs Law, I pitched camp.
