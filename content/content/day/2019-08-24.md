# 24th August 2019

I woke to a beautiful morning, and went all of about 10m before discovering I had camped right above an open quarry - just a small one, on the east side of Needs Law.

I had an easy way out of the forest, largely on tracks, which took me to a major watershed waypoint.

Its location on the English-Scottish border means that the summit of Peel Fell is well-known to walkers of the Scottish section of the watershed - it's frequently the point where they officially start or finish their journeys.

However â€“ less often mentioned is the fact that it's not quite the end of the watershed's journey in Scotland. The route continues south-west for about 14km, with the border roughly following it. So I was to briefly dip into England before crossing back over to Scotland and ascending the Larriston Fells, the summit-line of which lies entirely within Scotland.

The day continued warm and sunny. A substantial monument at the source of the North Tyne was a good spot for lunch. Walking across these largely ungrazed moorlands was hard work and time-consuming.

Finally I turned south-east towards Hobbs' Flow. With a name like that, I was expecting wet feet, but it turned out not to be so bad. It's certainly a less enticing spot than Peel Fell, but in its way deserves equal recognition. This is where the watershed crosses the border and leaves Scotland behind for good.

Not long after crossing the border, I properly entered Kielder Forest. The terrain was actually slightly easier in the forest, but no faster to cover ground. I camped shortly before leaving the forest, as the day's walking had taught me that there was likely to be little in the way of ground comfortable enough to pitch a tent on the open hillsides around here.
