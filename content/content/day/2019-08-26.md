# 26th August 2019

Surprisingly, I woke up to mist. It wasn't until I had left the forest, traversed a boggy section of moorland and re-entered the forest on the other side that it finally lifted for good.

At the minor summit of Burn Divot, I was delighted to find a herd of sheep. Suddenly walking became easy again. But it wasn't to last. Before long, I was back to toilsome long grass, home to numerous spiders who took pleasure in inflicting sharp bites - my best guess is that they were four spot orb weavers. I was kind of counting down the kilometres by this stage. There were some interesting views south to the various lumps which lie in-between the Pennines and the border hills. The day remained hot as I crossed Thirlwall Common, and upon reaching Gilsland, at the foot of Hadrian's Wall, I ended this leg, finishing with an easy walk down to Greenhead to get the last bus back to Carlisle.
