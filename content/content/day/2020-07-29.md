# 29th July 2020

I returned to Gilsland on a fine day and made my way through one last forest before climbing into the Pennines.

On top of Whinny Fell, a local householder, walking his dog, was already aware of the proximity of the watershed to his house. He obviously knew a bit of the local history of the area, telling me about the dozens of former mine workings in the Talkin Fell area.

I camped on the way up to Cold Fell, on the shoulder of Brown Fell, within site of the lonely house of Gairs.
