# 14th May 2016

The cloud descended yesterday, so it was a misty start to the horseshoe of Black Mount Munros. In the afternoon it lifted, however, so the last two provided amazing views in all directions.

I crossed the West Highland Way for the first time on Thursday, and then crossed it for a second time 24 hours later, only a few miles southâ€¦

Dropped back down to Rannoch Moor and now set for most of today crossing back east, before higher summits tomorrow. Today's looking fine, though cold.
