# 9th May 2018

It's drizzled all day, and felt pretty cold with the wind too. Currently taking shelter in Balfron's pub-turned-Indian-restaurant. The forecast is a little better for the next few days, fortunately. Into the hills again tomorrow (initially the Fintry Hills, east of the Campsies proper).
