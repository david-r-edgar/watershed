# 11th May 2018

Today has brought a few forests to navigate my way through, fire breaks or not… I'm now in the Campsies. The weather is dull, but was dry until a few minutes ago… Very wet underfoot (and indeed in-boot) for the past few days, although the sunny afternoon yesterday gave great views out as far as the Forth bridges.
