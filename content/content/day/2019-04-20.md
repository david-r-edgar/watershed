# 20th April 2019


A few awkward bits of forest to negotiate, and a bit of dehydration made this a slightly tougher day than it should have been. 


Saw a fox - in the middle of the day, unusually, and several deer, in the woods.


In the afternoon I went through the Black Law wind farm - at one point I stopped and counted 102 visible turbines.


Ended on Leven Seat next to another wind farm.
