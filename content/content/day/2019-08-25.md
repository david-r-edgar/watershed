# 25th August 2019

The watershed essentially describes a half-circle around the catchment area for Kielder Water (which drains to the North Tyne). Today's walk covered most of that. It was hot throughout, and the going was just as tough as on the past few days, particularly on the overgrown open fell tops. I'm conflicted, because while this is probably closer to the natural state of wild ground, crossing terrain like this takes substantially more effort than walking on the shorn grass of the Lake District, say, or the windswept high mountain tops of Scotland.

A small there-and-back side-trip to bag Sighty Crag, a Marilyn, gave me my only opportunity to glimpse the reservoir; it otherwise remained hidden behind the gentle hills and forests.

I camped by a junction of tracks in the middle of Wark Forest, with plenty of distance still to cover on my final day, but having satisfactorily achieved my distance objective for today.
