# 19th April 2019

I returned to Caldercruix on a warm and sunny spring day - in some ways even too hot for walking.


A typically winding route took me through fields and minor lumps in the landscape. In the early evening I crossed the M8. The next motorway the watershed crosses won't be until the M62, to the north-east of Manchester.


I finished the day close to Shotts. Finding water was slightly tricky, but I managed eventually. The night was pleasant so I didn't need to bother pitching my tent.
