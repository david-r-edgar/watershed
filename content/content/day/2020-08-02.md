# 2nd August 2020

Some unfortunately timed showers made the next morning less pleasant than it might have been.

Crossing the A66, a busy dual carriageway, was more work than for some roads, with walls and fences to climb, steep slopes to descend and not a lot of visibility around slight corners, especially with the rain.

It's a route following a significant pass across the North Pennines, and not far up on the south side, I came across the Stainmore pill-box, strategically positioned to overlook the highest point on the road, and therefore right on the line of the watershed. It's kind of unusual to see wartime installations like this inland in the north of the country.

After a bit more fairly generic moorland, the rain finally cleared up, and I crossed the road that leads to the famous Tan Hill Inn, just a few miles east of the line.

Somewhere on Brownber Edge, the catchment on the North Sea side changes again - having been following the Tees drainage since Cross Fell a few days ago, the top streams of Whitsundale Beck now lead down via Swaledale, the Ure and the Ouse, and eventually empty out, like all the major Yorkshire Dales, into the Humber Estuary.

My immediate destination was one I had been looking forward to for some time - Nine Standards Rigg. The nine "standards" - cairns - were conspicuous from several miles before I arrived. Here is where Wainwright's Coast to Coast Walk crosses the watershed.

I camped here a few years back, capturing a few fantastic shots of the night sky with the Standards silhouetted in front, so I was pleased to return, if only briefly.



Today I wanted to get a bit further along, and after crossing the boggy Lamps Moss, I climbed up on to the enjoyable ridge above Mallerstang Edge, camping not far after High Seat.
