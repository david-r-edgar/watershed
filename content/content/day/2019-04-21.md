# 21st April 2019

Feeling much better today, with sun but a good breeze helping, and with a bit of luck in terms of terrain to cross, I covered a long distance today. I crossed right through the western edge of the Pentlands - without seeing a single other hiker, despite it being Easter Sunday.


The summit of Craigengar marked a significant moment on the route - I moved from the Forth as my lefthand drainage basin to the Tweed - and since this officially flows into the sea in England, at Berwick-upon-Tweed, my first geographical connection with England. To my right, waters continue to drain towards the Clyde for a little while longer.
